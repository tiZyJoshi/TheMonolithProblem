# TheMonolithProblem

Trying to solve the Monolith Problem.
Services are represented as spheres. The dependencies between services are modeled as springs between those services. Let Unity Physics handle the rest.

Let the simulation run until you are happy with the result and hit space.
The services are clusterd by a kmeans clustering implementation found on github.
